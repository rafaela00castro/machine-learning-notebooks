In these assignments, I put machine learning concepts and algorithms into practice. The goals of the assignments were as follows:

- Understand the pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
- Develop proficiency in writing efficient vectorized code with numpy
- Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
- Training Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks 
- Gain experience with a major deep learning framework (TensorFlow)
